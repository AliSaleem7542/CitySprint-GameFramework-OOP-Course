# GameFramework-OOP-Course 🎮

A modular 2D game framework built in **C# (.NET / Windows Forms)** to demonstrate **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles through game development.

This project was developed as part of an academic course and structured to reflect **clean architecture, separation of concerns, and extensibility**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Game loop implementation
- Layered architecture (Core, Systems, Entities, UI)
- Collision & basic physics system
- Entity-based design (Player, Enemy, Bullet, PowerUp)
- Extendable framework for new mechanics
- Clean, readable, and maintainable code

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

The framework follows a **layered OOP design**:

GameFramework
│── Core → Game loop & base logic
│── Systems → Collision, physics, power-ups
│── Entities → Player, Enemy, Bullet, etc.
│── UI → GameForm & rendering
│── Utilities → Helpers & extensions


This structure ensures:
- Low coupling
- High cohesion
- Easy scalability
